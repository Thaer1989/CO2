#CO2  Vs Cows

##Project Idea:
Normally the most common way to emission the carbon is cars but actually the new researches says that eating less amounts of meat will help to decrease the carbon emission more than give up your car because we used to eat a piece of meat without thinking what happened to the  meat to become  like this and what is the procedures to get it.
In our website we will have a detailed essay about that, calculate the amount of carbon emission which we will get after eating meals containing meat. 

##Project details:

1-	First page is the home page and will contains elements as the following:

2-	Second page for sign up :
In this page anyone can register at our site by entering his information (Email, Name, Password..etc) also the amounts of meals containing meats which he used to eat and the new amount which he plan to eat.
